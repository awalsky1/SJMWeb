# SJM Website
To Whom It May Concern,
This project was originally created for my Senior Project at Wilmington University when getting my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. It was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. As of April 2nd, 2024, it is still under development and the folders are still very messy so I apologize ahead of time. I plan to reorganize my folders upon completion and also consolidating some things, but I want to complete the project first. As stated within the actual code, all information regarding Throne of Glass as a topic and any characters or entities regarding it, is solely owned by Sarah J. Maas. I do not claim any of the information to be my own. I only claim the code within the website itself.
Thank you,
Adrien Walsky
